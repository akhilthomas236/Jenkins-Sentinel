# Product Requirements Document: Jenkins Build Analyzer with Amazon Bedrock

## Overview
The Jenkins Build Analyzer is an intelligent agent that uses Amazon Bedrock's Large Language Models to analyze build failures, compare them with successful builds, and provide actionable insights for developers.

## Problem Statement
Developers often spend significant time analyzing Jenkins build failures, comparing logs with previous successful builds, and determining root causes. This process is manual, time-consuming, and may miss subtle patterns that could indicate underlying issues.

## Product Goals
1. Reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) for build failures
2. Provide intelligent, context-aware build analysis
3. Automate the comparison between failed and successful builds
4. Generate actionable recommendations for fixing build issues
5. Identify patterns in build failures across multiple jobs

## Target Users
- DevOps Engineers
- Software Developers
- Build Engineers
- QA Engineers
- System Administrators
